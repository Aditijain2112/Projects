# Projects
Project 1 - Created an interactive Superstore dashboard that visualizes key business metrics including sales, profit, and orders. The dashboard includes dynamic filters to explore data trends across different categories and regions, helping users gain insights into performance metrics quickly and efficiently

Project 2 - For my final project, I analyzed my recent trip to Spain and Portugal, focusing on expenses across key categories such as stay, food, transport, and activities, along with payment methods and time spent. The goal was to gain insights into spending patterns, resource allocation, and to identify trends for better budgeting in future travels. The data, collected throughout the trip, is structured into columns. The dashboard explores cost-to-time ratios, category breakdowns, and overall spending efficiency, providing a comprehensive view of the tripâ€™s financial dynamics."
